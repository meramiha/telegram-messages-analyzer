# Telegram Messages Analyzer
## Export chat
In telegram one can export chat history as a JSON. 
To do such you need to have a [Telegram QT client](https://desktop.telegram.org)

In chat click three dots button, `Export chat history`, choose format `Machine-readable JSON`.

## Run
You can use either 
```shell
./gradlew run --args='<path-to-chat-history>'
```

or

```shell
./gradlew installDist
```
this will generate a script which you can run as normal application

```shell
./build/install/telegram-messages-analyzer/bin/telegram-messages-analyzer '<path-to-chat-history>'
```

You can pass multiple `result.json` files generated by telegram, they will be joined and analyzed together.
